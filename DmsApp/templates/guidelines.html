    <h1>Disaster Safety Guidelines</h1>
    
    <h3>Earthquakes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Drop, cover, and hold on: Drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold on until the shaking stops.</li>
        <li>Stay away from windows and heavy furniture: Glass and objects can break and fall during an earthquake.</li>
        <li>Evacuate tall buildings and structures: After the shaking stops, evacuate tall buildings and structures as soon as it is safe to do so.</li>
        <li>Prepare an emergency kit: Include food, water, first-aid supplies, and other essential items.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hurricanes and Tropical Storms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Evacuate if advised: If you are in a coastal area and authorities issue an evacuation order, leave as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Secure your property: Take steps to protect your property from potential damage.</li>
        <li>Have a disaster supply kit: Include food, water, first-aid supplies, a battery-powered radio, flashlights, and other essentials.</li>
        <li>Stay informed: Keep up with the latest developments and any new warnings or evacuation orders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tornadoes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Take cover: If indoors, go to a basement, storm cellar, or an interior room on the lowest floor.</li>
        <li>Stay away from windows: Avoid windows, as they can break during a tornado.</li>
        <li>Protect your head: Cover your head with your hands or a pillow to protect yourself from falling debris.</li>
        <li>Evacuate mobile homes: Mobile homes are not safe during tornadoes; seek shelter in a nearby building.</li>
    </ul>
